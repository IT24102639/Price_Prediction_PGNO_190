I tried lubuntu 20 and ubuntu 22, it worked out of the box in both, didn't have to do any setup. There's an extender cable so you can place this in a comfortable place.

This is a big plus as it is easy plug in and use, add to it the good sober design.Build Quality:The build quality is undoubtedly superb. Just no qualms about that, at all. When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards. This is bad, really.Speed:It easily supports net speeds upto 300 Mbps. Practically speaking, I have tested it at my home and it easily supports net speed of over 100-150 Mbps without a sigh.On testing I found that it did connect to 5GHz network, without any issue.Connectivity:Please mark its not feet its metres. Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet. I mean even our old bluetooth used to connect to about 15 ft.So 20-25 feet is not at all an issue with this. This is the big plus I found with the product.Experience:From this point of view, so far except the linux non-compatibility issue, I found no other flaws with this product.So overall its a great product.Warranty:Its 3 years so I am assured that atleast for 3 years I am tension-free and not just 1 year, contrary to most electronic items today that only provide 1 year warranty with their items.,Best adapter I have bought ever.

Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31nrDWDT8+L._SX300_SY300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-Micro-Charging-Android-Phones/dp/B07232M876/ref=sr_1_53?qid=1672909126&s=electronics&sr=1-53,9

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 ‚Ä¶,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don‚Äôt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4.

Simply put up a similar replica for something successful but at much affordable prices.If something isn‚Äôt an immediate hit, Amazon pulls it and moves on.Amazon otherwise is like an online marketplace where it provides a portal for various sellers to sell their product BUT with amazonbasics - Amazon is selling its own product at its own marketplace .Here it derives the benefit of eliminating any intermediate distributors or retailers & hence amazonbasics branded products are available for a lower price attracting bulk customers online.As an additional benefit, Amazonbasics products are delivered free to prime members & are covered under amazon warranty for all and hence any claim or replacement procedures are highly streamlined & immediately taken care of.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT ( REQUIREMENT vs ACTUAL):xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxI recently purchased a new Qualcomm 3 Qbix car charger & was looking for a cable with USB A to Micro B connector. I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31iESA2h2gL._SY300_SX300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-Micro-Charging-Android-Phones/dp/B0711PVX6Z/ref=sr_1_55?qid=1672909126&s=electronics&sr=1-55,9

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily.

Simultaneously I was using the USB ports in the Hub for connectivity of my wireless mouse and one port for external hard-disk.  This continuously gave me problems with connectivity of the mouse or the HDD.  I got errors like USB device not detected etc.  Till a point, where it refused to detect my mouse.At home, I used the hub for connecting only to my external HDDs (two numbers) and it is working fine.  For a moment, I was trying to return the product, but since I got this delivered in Mumbai at my Office and then I had returned home to Karnataka, it refused to process return in a different city.Right now, it is working fine, since I do not need ethernet at home.,Speed is more than wireless,I am not used since it restricted in my system.,I have used it with HP and Dell Laptop. It‚Äôs compatible with all. It‚Äôs plug and play and easy to use.,Good product,It works perfectly,A trusted and a reliable brand with a convenient design having a slot for folding the cable. It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I‚Äôm working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it‚Äôs not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would‚Äôve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn‚Äôt make these strange design decisions. Hope this helps.

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily.

When held, it doesnt give off that cheap and flimsy product-like feeling. It is good sturdy with its build quality.Packaging:This part is also a big plus as the item was well cushioned and packaged with all the necessary items that ensured that no damage could have been caused to the product during transportation. This ensures that I as a customer have received something not damaged internally already.Software:This is actually good but not great part with the product.The good part is that a CD has been provided with it along with a manual.The not great part is that NO LINUX SUPPORT has been given from Version 2 onwards.

Multiply metres x 3 to get the distance in feet.It easily connects to my laptop or phone from 7 metres across one room. So thats 21 feet.

Have been using it since and it works neat. The cable is tough due to its braided nature.,Overall good for usage, not faced any quality issues. C point section is also good to fit properly in mobile. You can go for it.,Most expensive cable I have ever purchased. Probably the best cable too. Giving 1 star less for the premium pricing.I bought this as the long cables dont work well with Android Car. This works very well. Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ‚Çπ309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won't come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars, I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use, the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ‚Çπ300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality, the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle, I am sure I will put it through some abuse and I can comment on the same when I revisit this review for updates.Durability:I will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective, as my first Wayona dash charge cable I used for Oneplus 6 died in 3 months. But thankfully it was replaced under warranty. That shows how good the support is from Wayona team. I only had to record that the cable died and doesn't charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product.Verdict:If you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on  or for charging devices from powerbanks, I would definitely recommend this cable.,Data transfer is quite fast, and also, compatible with my QC adapter.,Good,Excellent...

(Using it since 3 days).One NEGATIVE point is short length... It is 1 meter long ... Original cable is 1.5 meters... So it is difficult to use my phone while charging.....Other NEGATIVE point I can figure out is that cable is really hard... In my experience hard cables break more often than soft pliable ones... It is not easy to put a hard cable in my bag without putting strain on it (for daily commute to office)... this makes them to break easily before time.....Hard cables are also not easy to use when the mobile is charging... It puts strain on both the points, the charger side and mobile side, which again makes it vulnerable to cracks...This raises a question on longevity of the cable.....Let's do some calculations.....My original OnePlus cable lasted for 2 years, cost of which at present is Rs.1100.... it was soft, easy to bend and keep in my bag while traveling daily for work.... The Rs.1100 cable online is 1.5 meters long, which makes it easy to work on phone while it is plugged.....Popio cable costs Rs.400 at present (but they show it 999 , which means price may rise) ... So, even if it lasts for 6-8 months, it will be more costly to me than an original cable in 2 years... Popio cable is 1 meter long, against 1.5 meters of original cable... So effective price of popio cable is Rs.500 for 1.5 meter cable...Popio cable is 1 meters long against 1.5 meters of original cable... Which makes it not easy to use the phone while it is charging.... Using a short cable while charging puts strain on the cable and phone's charging port, which is damaging for both, and also decreases life of both the cable and charging port.....They say you have to consider cost while writing review... But you should also consider cost on long run, not just the immediate cost.... ..So, if u are thinking of changing your phone in coming future and don't want to spend too much on cable, Popio is the best option available....But, if you are looking for a long term solution, and you can afford to buy Rs.1100 cable, I will suggest to go for the original one.... It has more length, it is soft, and it lasts longer with moderate use...,I ordered this cable for 330/- in the sale yesterday. When i plugged in the cable it wasn't charging Rapidly on my OnePlus.

It made me start building trust on the brand.I use S21 ultra which can be charged at 25W and this cable supports the same with the Samsung's original charger. I strongly believe the product would work at the rated power delivery (60W).It looks and feels sturdy and I am expecting it to be durable too.The 90¬∞ ends keep the cables away without out interfering with the work space. Works the best when playing battle royale games as the cable won't come in the way.The grey and black colour combination works as a charm and would blend in with Apple devices.Data transfer speeds are yet to be tested. I will update here once I have enough inputs on the same.After using multiple cables from Ambrane, Wayona, Wecool, and more brands Portronics definitely stands as a good contender for all of them that serve the same purpose.Verdict: I would definitely recommend this Type-c to Type-c cable if you need to charge devices at 60W or less.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41ngtt1EmoL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Portronics-Konnect-Charging-Resistant-Braided/dp/B09Q8WQ5QJ/ref=sr_1_244?qid=1672909136&s=electronics&sr=1-244,9

Then I went into windows display settings (as Nvidia settings didn't have refresh rate more than 60 Hz) to change the refresh rate to 144 Hz and it switched without any issues. Avoid jerks to the monitor as I figured the display goes off for a brief 1 or 2 secs post jerking. Rest the cable quality is good, However locks to the display ports could be appreciated.

Go for it if you have to connect with Android Auto.,Short review:This eliminates a need to wrap long cables around the handlebar when the phone is mounted on it for navigation. Compact and powerful. Best suited for motorcycle mobile mounts and powerbanks.[Price bought at: ‚Çπ309]_______________________________________________________________________________________Long review:I used to wrap long charging cables around the handle bar so that it won't come in the way while turning. After being fed up of wrapping cables to handlebars, I wanted something short just to sit there and charge device and clear the clutter on motorcycle handle. This is just what I wanted.I have a Mobile mount that looks like BOBO gears jaw grip mount from local stores and that delivers 5v ~2.4A. Tried few cables from local stores and they either die or doesn't charge the device enough when it is in use. Even when the device is not in use, the charging rate used to be low.That is when I have decided to give this one a try as I was always hesitant that ‚Çπ300+ for a short cable is too high. Now I am pretty happy with the purchase that it can fetch the complete charging capacity of the mobile charger and deliver it to the device. I did a 400kms roundtrip and this has been a saviour. I am yet to check if the claimed QC3.0 is true but at least it serves the purpose on my motorcycle handlebar so I have no complaints. I will update when I get a chance to test that.Coming to the design and quality, the braided cable looks rugged and the metal connectors feel solid. As I am going to use it only on the motorcycle, I am sure I will put it through some abuse and I can comment on the same when I revisit this review for updates.Durability:I will have to use it more and update this review on the durability perspective, as my first Wayona dash charge cable I used for Oneplus 6 died in 3 months. But thankfully it was replaced under warranty. That shows how good the support is from Wayona team. I only had to record that the cable died and doesn't charge any more and they too that video as evidence to replace the product.Verdict:If you are looking for a short cable for mobiles on  or for charging devices from powerbanks, I would definitely recommend this cable.,Data transfer is quite fast, and also, compatible with my QC adapter.,Good,Excellent...

Other cords with same charger are okay.,Ok,Cable looks solid and length is also good.Little bit fast charging I observed for phones like Redmi.It also looks solid so I am expecting it to work for atleast 1 year,build quality and fast charging feature,Unbreakable, good quality,Cable a Nice Product",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41DXzzwydTL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Wayona-Charger-Samsung-Galaxy-Wc3Cb1/dp/B07F1P8KNV/ref=sr_1_338?qid=1672909141&s=electronics&sr=1-338,9

If the device has the same matte black theme, this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the device's body. As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly¬†the product has merged with it. The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.It is ultra-thin as described by the company with¬†acquiring about a millimeter thickness. This thickness can cope with the windows¬†laptops as they are having¬†the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen.¬†This spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid¬†will not harm the screen, screen frame, and laptop lower-up body. But, still, don't put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers, than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself. The sliding function is very smooth, but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage.The device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids.Now, for the ""Mac Laptop '' users, it is not a product for your¬†laptop, and never try this product for your Mac laptops. As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers, that is there's no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this¬†product will damage (crack/break) the plain glass screen.Installation is easy, remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker, using the scale for support, or else you could stick it a little inclined. After sticking, rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra-light pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes. And there you go for your satisfied invisible life.*Important - Even if not in use, slide it 2-5 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust.Overall, it is a good product. For me, it has worked awesome. Green Signal from here.Thank You :)SUGGESTIONSTo the Manufacturer - Notice the static frame of the webcam¬†cover, and make its edges (the edges close to the slider) smooth (rounding off or fillet), so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easily¬†slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.To the Seller - Well packagingTo the Consumer - Check for the rubber spacers/buffers provided in the laptop (like Windows laptops), if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not (like Mac laptops), it's not the product for you. Even for Windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. Slide it 2-5 times once a week to avoid jamming.DISCLAIMERThe review(s) and rating(s) has(ve) been made upon personal usage(s) / experiment(s) / experience(s) / perspective(s) for specific product(s) acquired / delivered.,I usually don't trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try. It was delivered within 3 days after placing the order. I received it on 12th June. First impressions were really good. I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but It's been 3.5 months and there's not even a single crack in my screen.ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùó§ùòÇùóÆùóπùó∂ùòÅùòÜ ùü∞.ùü±/ùü±You will get 3 webcams covers in the package. It's extremely thin. So, It won't cause any issues when you close the laptop(Hp pavilion gaming used here) but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air, Asus TUF, Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. At the end it's your choice.ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª ùüØ/ùü±I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak. It literally falls off after a week of applying it. I had to throw 2 of it as it became useless. I only had the last piece remaining.ùó¶ùóºùóπùòÇùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùó≥ùóºùóø ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª : Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem.‚Ä¢ Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol.‚Ä¢ Then apply a strong Adhesive glue (I used Fevi Kwick). Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover. Since it's extremely thin, I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue  will spill out and make a mess.‚Ä¢ Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. And then you're good to go.Its been 3 months after using the Super Glue technique. Forget about about falling, It has not even moved a bit. No effect on the quality of my webcam. The cover won't interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. And fully covers it when you want privacy. Overall, Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,Good product,I wish I had known this before ordering. Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied it.Apple urges people not to close their MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook!!! It may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.MacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. This item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!If you are going to use it on your MacBook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. You can use it without worry on iMac as it's a desktop and doesn't get closed. You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn't embedded inside the glass screen. If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.For disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options. One is you trust Apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. According to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.If you're not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don't see how there could be an issue.Why am I still giving this product 3 stars? It reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. It's not a bad product. They just need to stop advertising it for MacBooks!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41PeQz-jDSL._SX300_SY300_QL70_ML2_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/LIRAMARK-Webcam-Blocker-Computer-MacBook/dp/B08BQ947H3/ref=sr_1_317?qid=1672895842&s=electronics&sr=1-317,20

Bought this yesterday, so haven‚Äôt used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me.,The quality of power button is very low easily it can break,Nice Product, works as expected as of now no issues,Good,Very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.There's a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons (right/left clicks)It will not bother most of you, I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things, So...[Personally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, (click click click)]Battery life of Logitech is known to be very good.,Quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price.,good product on which you can use for long time,This is good mouse, thanks to Amazon for providing this product at reasonable price. Very sharp and correct working mouse.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31y-oJ1XnqL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-B170-Wireless-Mouse-Black/dp/B01J0XWYKQ/ref=sr_1_6?qid=1672902995&s=computers&sr=1-6,17

Review is based on testing done the same day:Summary:The product is genuine and sturdy, but the performance is just about average, based on a random file copy performance to fill the entire space.Pros & Cons (comparing with SanDisk Cruiser Blade 32 GB) :Pros-1. Solid body, looks and feels great.2. Read speed is fine (22 MB/s).3. Product is genuine, covered under 2 Year manufacturer warranty.Cons -1. Fits too tight in usb port, thus causing more wear to the port and may even damage it if not used carefully.2. Capacity is 31 GB (precisely 31042043904 bytes), not 32 as advertised. In windows it'll show up as a 28.9 GB drive compared to 29.8 in Sandisk. No big deal, just a technical observation.3. Write speed (3.3 MB/s) is not bad, but slightly inferior to its close competitor Sandisk cruiser blade which easily gives 4 to 4.4 MB/s for the same test.4. Warranty is only 2 years, compared to 5 years on Sandisk. But since almost nobody claims warranty after 2 years, and besides- the plastic body of Sandisk gets physically damaged in 2 years anyway, so it's okay for me.Bottomline:It's good enough for casual users, maybe chosen over Sandisk for its look, feel and sturdiness. Frequent users may want to look for better options- with easier port fitting and better write speed.Details:The product name is HP v236w as shown on its packing (the images in listing are correct) while its part number is FD236W-32, so slightly confusing but both are the same thing.Testing whether it is genuine or fake:The bottom of the hologram sticker on the packing has a silver layer with ""scratch and check"" written on it. Scratching it reveals a 20-digit code beneath it, and the right edge of the sticker has the url ""www.pny.com.tw"" to verify this code. Go to support > product authentication page on that url. That page contains instructions and explanation of the results that you may get. Mine were originals, with the codes tested for the first time (repeat test result will be a warning that the code was tested before).So that means it is covered under 2 year manufacturer warranty, as declared by hp for Aisa Pacific region.Design and build quality : Sturdy, stylish but with a design flaw-It is exactly as shown in the picture. The body is a solid steel case with open front and the back sealed with a black plastic cap. The plastic back fits perfectly and gives it a stylish look, though it may come off later. The HP logo, product code etc are embossed on the steel body so likely won't be erased with time. Overall, it looks and feels great. The flaw I noticed was that it takes significantly more strength to push it into the usb port, compared to other usb devices like generic usb cables or usual plastic pendrives like Sandisk. You almost have to fight with it to push it in or pull it out. This means its frequent use can wear out the usb port too soon, or may even break it if not used carefully.Capacity : 31 GB, not 32, will appear as 28.9 GB in windows-It is advertised as a 32 GB drive but the actual capacity is 31GB, and yes, I'm fully aware of the decimal vs binary calculation difference, I'm a hardcore linux user. To be precise, its exact capacity is 31042043904 bytes (on both pendrives I tested). So in windows it will show up as a 28.9 GB drive. In linux it will show up as either 31 GB, or 28.9 GiB (binary calculation like windows). For comparison, my 32GB Sandisk shows up as 32010928128 bytes, or 32 GB, or 29.8 GiB. This loss of 1 GB in a 32GB pendrive is no big deal for me, just a technical observation.Performance:Read speed: about 20-22 MB/sWrite speed: about 3.3 MB/sTested with : a collection of ISO files ranging from about 350MB to 4GB, along with a few smaller files like pdf or txt. Total size of the collection was about 30.2 GB (28.2 GiB).I did this testing on linux, so to be fair, the write performance may be slightly better on windows as it works better with fat32 that the pendrive comes formatted as.(Edit: No performance difference on Windows either. Formatted as exFAT on windows 10 to make it multiboot with YUMI. Read-write speeds were same while copying ISO files to it, or reading them to load in memdisk while booting.)I could do more accurate testing with tools like dd command but didn't bother as the difference usually isn't very significant.,Ups.....The product is very good, i mistakenly washed it 8n washing machine with my pants but it is still running like new. No data loss problem or data corrupt problems i have faced yet.Downs......The only downside is this pendrive is little slow because of technology 2.0(3.2 is newer one)And second one is not affact your data at all.. the silver paint on pendrive is vanishing time by time and it is now turning black,Product is good but slow,Storage is good but doesn‚Äôt work for car stereo,57 GB OUT OF 64,So far so good,Good product,Ok",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31febYa30qL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/HP-v236w-64GB-USB-Drive/dp/B01L8ZNWN2/ref=sr_1_21?qid=1672902995&s=computers&sr=1-21,41

After getting it checked I found out that the issue was in the UPS (maybe wiring cable) which stopped transmission.I contacted the customer care and I was assisted by Mr. Ankit. He was very helpful and asked me to demonstrate the issue in video and tried to ascertain the issue through other checkups too. After ascertaining that the issue is in the product he confirmed to get the default product replaced and started the issue and informed me on tentative timelines for the same. Hoping to receive the replacement soon so that I can continue uninterrupted internet !!,I have been using this product for the past four months, during this tenure I had faced no issues initially but roughly after 3 months the power back up started shrinking extremely and the least duration was under 30 minutes, that‚Äôs when I contacted the customer support via whatsapp and I must say the whole experience with the customer support team was simply surprising. They were very polite and helpful throughout the process. It was very easy for me to explain the issue to them then at the end of the first conversation itself they arranged a replacement for the product since it is just 3-4 months old. They took all the responsibility of the issue and sent me a new product which I am currently using, now the back up I am getting is 4+ hours which is based on my usage.So finally I am not sure how often I buy a product from this brand but I will never forget the support I received from this this brand. Cheers!!!,I purchased the product 10 days back and initial product was not working properly. But I received a replacement for that. Thanks for immediate response from the support team. I liked Oakter because it's Indian product and NOT a Chinese. As of now it's working fine and no lag in Wi-Fi connection or speed. Need to test the recharge capacity when the Power goes off. Will keep you updated after a month again by checking the results. Giving 4 Stars as of now.,This is a really good option for those who are primarily concerned about being cut off from online meetings/calls due to frequent short term power cuts, and are not willing to spend more amount buying an inverter. I have been using this product since around 3 months and am pretty happy with its backup.,I have been using the product for more than a year. Later I purchased a second product for my parents home and it was working fine for 6 months. However the backup battery stopped working later and the customer support team were quick to respond and swiftly sent me the replacement product.,Product was delivered very promptly and packaging was good. Using this product just from couple of days and its working as expected. Very easy to plug & use. Reserving 1 star for longevity of this product, will revise my rating after a year or so depending on my experience.,The device doesn't support for 4 hours. It support only for 2 or 2 hours 30 minutes max on full recharge.Product is affordable, light and good. Please don't fool on 4 hours support capacity. Resonate UPS is better as compared  to this.,This product claims to give backup for upto 4hours. But it wont even give backup for 30 mins. I claimed warranty and got the new product as well still the same problem. They reiterate and say upto 4 hours where they shud mention clearly that it will give backup upto 1 hour not more than that.One of the worst customer support services i have seen. The associates keep repeating the same sentence or copy paste the chat and dont provide solutions. Totally disappointed and waste of money. Never recommending anyone to buy their product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/31PfpEPlg-L._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Mini-UPS-Router-WiFi-12V/dp/B08HLZ28QC/ref=sr_1_83?qid=1672902998&s=computers&sr=1-83,44

It is a good thing as it prevents damage to the storage component, hence increasing lifespan, but at the cost of speeds. But after 33mpbs, it further drops down to 20, then 13 and becomes stable there. Here it's just too slow for heavy everyday use like transferring videos for editing. (Room temp 24C), your milage may vary with different types of files, computers and ports))But for the vast majority of users, who just use it as a backup, or for once in a while storage, or for regularly working with small files like pots and photos, it's perfectly fine. Its fast, makes it convenient to transfer files between phones and laptops and desktops, because of it's versatile setup of a changeable usb c and a setup. It feels strong and durable, even through its made if plastic.For the price of 719rs (for the 64gb variant) it is not very affordable. A regular usb a pen/flash drive and a type a to c adapter combination (as illustrated above, available for about rs 130 as of writing this review, and a 64GB flash drive costing anywhere between 400 and 550rs as of writing this review) will cost less. But a regular usb drive and the combo will not be as convenient and fast, but again it's not required for most people not to mention that the adapter is quite useful elsewhere as well; but for the small niche of users who want speed and have small files (below 1.5GB at a time) to work with, it's recommend.Otherwise going with the luxe (for performance) or the adapter setup (better value for money) as mentioned above will be a better decision.Hope you find this effort helpful,It would be better if the holder of pendrive is strong enough.And it's very hard to insert into my type c mobile (lgg8x).I got bit scared thinking of it will get broken.Better to buy this in offer the price gets less than I bought.

Right Click BT Icon in Taskbar-->Add Bluetooth Device--.Audio/Video Device then Search for the BT Device...Now when you connect give it about 10 seconds--> then once connected it should provide the Stereo mode under Speaker icon in Taskbar. Once you disconnect, depending on any other Headset you will have to go back to these settings and Disable Content Protected device.

(BT signal is radio transmission)The 2nd heading is for turning on/off Discovery (Transmit/Receive on/off)The 3rd heading is Add Bluetooth Device. when you highlight this it will bring up the table which showsPhone,  Computer,  Audio/Video device,  Printer/Imaging Device,  and Keyboard/Mouse,  ALL.The 4th heading is Show Bluetooth Devices (devices that are Already Connected)The 5th heading is Bluetooth Settings (only for TPlink Bluetooth Dongle,not onboard bluetooth)The 6th and last heading that mine shows is  About (this brings up the software provider and vers., there is no Update option here, we have to physically check the TPlink website for UB400)I only use Audio Devices, I don't have any other BT products so I am unable to test other than headsets.under Add heading go to Audio/Video Device left click --> brings up dialogue box to Select a device to connect with this Computer. at the bottom right corner click Search (make sure your headset is on and not connected to any other system/home theater/smartphone.Once the Device shows up you can sigle click on it then Next on bottom of page or you can double click. Either will connect to the device. Once it is ""Connected"", give about 10 to 15 seconds for Windows to recognize the Connection. You will see what the options are in next description -->In the taskbar click the audio profile (speaker icon) Here there are 4 options that pop up for me --->(**Note-if you only see 2 or 3 then read the section above that says SOME HEADSETS may not work properly) TV sound, Laptop speakers, Bluetooth Audio Renderer (Stereo) and Bluetooth Hands Free Audio (Mono).Click on Bluetooth Audio Renderer (Stereo) wait a few seconds for it to comply.Now your headset should be connected.In watching Youtube I do get some lag but with different headsets the lag increases or decreases.The same with me using VLC or Windows Media Player. Sometimes if I stop the video app and restart then it will be no lag.I don't use ZOOM,Teams,Skype, so I cannot test how the mic setup would function.Any one that has any input for this please use any or all of my post and add to it. This would be helpful to alot of people.*FIRST post* So for a few months I was using it strictly thru Win10 utilizing Win10 drivers and bluetooth connection page thru Settings/System. But a few times i tried to use with music streaming to Sony XB400 or Oneplus Buds Wireless Bass edition and there would be intermittant drops. Also when it came to pairing and connecting it would consistanly slow down my HP AMD A6 chipset laptop. Also anytime I took the dongle out it would also affect disconnect my thumbdrive. So I assumed it was a throttling going on with my USB ports. I have Sandisk Dual Drive, WD Passport, DVi to HDMI and Logitech dongle. So one by one i disconnected everything and left the BT dongle and it was a little better.So I checked the TP Link India site for any FAQ related. When I searched in the Downloads->Drivers section there was software driver present.  So I downloaded, installed it and Win10 taskbar shows BT icon to use theBT Dongle. The Driver software is by CSR Harmony Wireless Software Stack Version 2.1.63.0.Once installed there are more options that can be accessed thru the BT icon in taskbar. The BT icon sits in the system tray as before. Audio transmission can be switched between stereo and mono. Also if your playing a video or audio file and you start the pairing process once connected there will be slight pause then it connects to the output in stereo. It works really well, I purchased a long usb male to female cable and now i have a little bit more increase in connection distance. I have not tried this for transfer of files. If and when I find a need to do so I will update.for now, at this price point it gives me freedom to connect my BT audio gear instead of purchasing a more expensive unit to give my laptop BT capabilites. and this is as small if not smaller than some thumbdrives. Oh and I also purchased a seperate QZ Powered USB hub for my drives. So the only USB devices connected are the Dongle, and the hub. Now when I disconnect the BT dongle my drives stay connected.I hope this information is helpful, I tried not to make it too long but it happened. If any questions arise please drop me a line and I will respond with whatever help I can give.,TP link products usually work well...while longevity with continuous use may vary, but these devices are not intended for prolonged or continuous use..I have had multiple to link devices ranging from wifi adapters, routers, range extenders, etc..Now I have tried this Bluetooth adapter..Pros:-Minuscule size, you can keep attached to the device, not noticeableBut not recommended to do so..as it's usually set to discoverable during setup and it has decent range..so if one is too skeptical, might lead to security issues.. although the hacker will have to be in the same house probably!Range is decent..works good in the same room..this kind of device is usually meant for local connectivity, usually without barriers...I use it to connect headphones to the PC and it works nicely for that..I earlier had a Bluetooth 2.0 adapter from enter and that worked well too, except for the range and bandwidth required nowadays has increased..so some choppy audio did occur with today's high quality audios and that got managed with this Bluetooth 4.0 adapter..nice clean audio..Lastly, it works nicely with Linux..i use debian based Ubuntu..and its almost plug and play..I did have blueman Bluetooth manager installed from the previous adapter I had.. And when I plugged it in..i didn't have to do anything else..So unlike what the site says, about only windows, it definitely works with Linux..I can't say if the 5.0 version UB500 will work though...While installing the driver in windows, I noticed it was installing CSR stackAnd CSR original chip ( there are many fake ones) is known to work with Linux..so maybe that's why it worked well..Coming to windows, i have win7.I had bluesoleil pre-installed, and it worked with it.Didn't have to install any driver separately..But there is a driver available in their site for xp/7..In win8 and above, it's supposed to be plug and play..So no issues there..Now the cons:-A bit high price than rest of the companies.. probably can improve on that....i bought it for 400Audio quality is good, but somehow, compared to my enter Bluetooth 2.0 stack..The audio was a bit muted..had to increase the volume higher to reach the same level of loudness..but even then, i feel, a slight reduction in the dynamic range of the audio.. no idea if that's a software or hardware issue..encoding/decoding issue..It's not very noticeable.. specially of someone doesn't have anything to compare with..Lastly, the windows driver is 400 MB!granted it has both 32 and 64 versions..but each one is almost 200 MB!Thats way to big for a driver of these devices..Neither bluesoleil/blueman cross 30MB..So I don't know what is being packaged in those drivers..Also, somehow the driver didn't have a clean install in my system, something to do with incorrect loading of c++ library...It didn't matter as I already had another driver installed..Overall a nifty little device.I have no need for 5.0 Bluetooth as i don't have any device that requires it..I just needed a 4.0 adapter to solve the bandwidth problem..and that purpose is nicely served and that it works both in win and linux is very helpful..Does the job well, few consHence one star less..,Using it for 2 weeks. Just plug it , install drivers and you are good to go ! Seem less connection with ps5 controller! Latency is very low around 1ms . So basically connection is even faster than wired connection (2ms) .  But when I simultaneously connect airpods gen 2 the sound output was very weak , it was muffled! But it serves my main purpose with ps5 controller .,Apparently, it seems like its the most relevant Bluetooth adapter out there good connectivity and all sort of stuffs like that, generally comes in a BT adapters I'd say the only con is the installation part it took a while figure out which was their website and drivers of ub500 aside from this everything is fabulous.,Very easy to install, connectivity is also good but sometimes while using Bluetooth earphones sound cracks also Bluetooth sharing is quite slow .....that's all*Otherwise th product is very good*,1) Easy to install, I mean just plug in .2) Connectivity is on all point but 1-2 time i feel fumble issues.3) sound quality is all depends on your wireless speaker.,If you are tight budget, it's okay then. Otherwise if can spend 150/- extra, go for BT 5.0 version. Much better in both range and connectivity.,Like",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31TZq2dY-hL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Receiver-UB500-Controllers/dp/B098K3H92Z/ref=sr_1_117?qid=1672903000&s=computers&sr=1-117,46

As of February 2015, it is the third-largest manufacturer of flash memory.SanDisk was founded in 1988 by Eli Harari, Sanjay Mehrotra and Jack Yuan with Sanjay mehrotra being the president & the CEO.On May 12, 2016, SanDisk was acquired by hard drive manufacturer Western Digital in a US$19 billion deal.WHY A DUAL- DRIVE, WHY 64 GB & WHY SANDISK?xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxBefore we proceed with the muscle-merits or the key features of the device, let‚Äôs have a quick look upon my personal selection process.Dual Drive : Apart from my need for a basic pen drive with sufficient storage, I chose to go with a dual drive that could work with my mobile devices to offload it of the memory burdens and play some stored media at instant whenever a desire crosses over. I could have gone with a basic pendrive with a USB to OTG adaptor cable but then I realized, in today‚Äôs comfort-seeking world, who‚Äôs will keep track for the tiny adaptor cable or moreover take the trouble every time to fetch it ,then fit it ,in event of a sudden mood swing for any mobile media requirement.64 GB : This capacity seemed to offer a decent compromise between storage, price & future proofing as with modern mobile cameras photos and videos shot are mostly of high resolution and larger size.64 GB ensures that you won‚Äôt have to empty it out any sooner or on a regular basis.Sandisk : In the recent few years, Sandisk after becoming a western digital brand has witnessed a tremendous growth in market capitalization, quality and brand image & offers the best value for money deals for an average usage.Moreover, could not find much, reputed brands in the Storage with OTG feature.A Note : Speed enthusiasts though should refrain from this version & should try its designated speedier extreme versions or other brands like transcend, Samsung.ABOUT OUR PRODUCT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx@ The device comes with the title ‚ÄúSanDisk Ultra - Dual Drive m3.0‚Äù and is the newer 2017 version of its previous iteration. Here I need to quote that the term ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù came quite as a surprise to me as I found nothing in lines with a common understanding of Ultra. We will discuss it in detail in upcoming columns of speed.@ With a micro-USB connector on one end and a USB 3.0 connector on the other, the drive lets you move content easily between your android phones, tablets (with micro USB ports only) or laptops.Both the connectors are carved out of metal & the USB 3.0 connector is backward-compatible with USB 2.0 ports.@ SIZE : The size of the USB is quite small which can be good for easy storage in your pockets but might be tedious to find if misplaced.The USB fares around an inch in perfect closed condition and 1.5‚Äùinches when expanded at USB end.@ CONSTRUCTION: The device has a plastic body & the overall construction of the drive is just average. The retractable plastic column seems to the weakest link of all and would surely break if you accidentally step over it. However the actual drive storage portion is built of a rigid plastic and won‚Äôt give up so easily. Both the USB ports are built of metal which again is quite a relief.@ FIT & FINISH: Being equipped with a retractable mechanism & being too small, the drive is not so smooth to use & slide-in or out in a single shot and needs some getting used to but then most of the OTG drives are designed small and hence have some or the other odd way of conserving size.The USB ports fit comfortably in devices and pulling it out too is fairly easy.@ STORAGE FORMAT: Since the previous FAT32 version had a limitation of file transfer size of a maximum of 4 GB for a single file & NTFS was not compatible with mac OS so with increasing file sizes ex FAT format was devised which doesn‚Äôt have a size limitation like FAT yet is compatible with Mac as well. So our drive has only ex FAT & NTFS formats to choose & comes in ex FAT by default with 128 KB file allocation size. Increasing the file allocation size may increase the transfer speeds a little but will affect the storage capacity little too. Changing it from 128 to 256 KB increased my write speeds from 13 MB/s to 15 MB/s if that‚Äôs a relief to anyone.The format would surely work well with most of the TVs, tablets and mobiles though check it with the car audio head unit and try to change to NTFS if it doesn‚Äôt work.@ SPEED (  The de-merit detail )  : I have been a flagship gadgets freak all my life & Preliminary to my purchase I had doubts regarding its speed as quoted by fellow buyers but then I did not have speed in my mind as a primary motive for this & there were not many options for dual OTG device, So I took a leap of faith and went ahead with purchase.My basic intent was to load bulk movies from my laptop into it and watch it over my TV or mobile, However when I was transferring 6 movies of a total size 8.1 GB , it started showing 15 minutes which kept on getting higher & it felt like waiting forever for it to happen.Even for a single movie of 1.8 GB it took 2 minutes 30 sec by stopwatch to transfer. The write speeds started with 13 MB/sec and went down & down to 10-11 MB/sec. Even with my older Kingston DT elite 3.0 16GB,the write speeds were in excess of 21 MB/Sec.I admit I have a USB 2.0 port at my laptop yet I was never used to such low speeds ever. The tagline ‚ÄúUltra‚Äù and mentioned speeds of 130 MB/sec (which I suppose is the rated max. speeds at USB 3.0 ports) felt like a dream and beyond exaggeration.Finally with every passing minute it became all the more unbearable and annoying. Even in NTFS format speeds were the same.I had never expected it to be this slow in this modern era of 2018, thus finally I decided to return it but I suppose I will only get a replacement & not reversal.I know that read-write speeds depend upon a lot of factors including transferred file type, format configuration of drive, configuration of host & destination device etc.Benchmark Crystal Disk mark scores for a file transfer of 500 MB size were 34 MB/s -Read & 19 MB/s ‚Äì write which looked like a mere consolation. Transfer between my Samsung S7 mobile & S2 tablet too was not fast.Verdict : Yes my friends , all other reviews about this being slow to the point of being unbearable are absolutely right and maybe San disk should retag it as ‚ÄúUltra-slow‚Äù.@ STORAGE : Out of the total name plate rating of 64 GB , the actual allocated space for usage is around 57 GB which is ok enough.@ WARRANTY : The product comes with a 5 year limited warranty which is one of the segment best offers.@ PRICE : I bought the device for 1530 bucks which was reasonable to me given the storage size, Dual drive & brand image. MRP over the pack was printed 2190 bucks & it was tagged made in Malaysia. Only if, it was a bit faster.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxAll in all, in my personal opinion given the brand image, Ultra-tagline & modern day technology advancements, even if you try to be too generous or lenient upon the transfer speeds yet its hard to spare such a low Read Write rates.Even for routine tasks it will keep on reminding you of the compromise you made for a full price. It could have been a great all-rounder device coupled with the good brand reputation of Sandisk & 5 years of warranty, had its speed been any better.,COVERED HERE: Actual storage space, Heating, Mobile Phones, Tight Fitting on mobile phones, Speed, Formatting File System, Value for Money, Free App, Company, Brand, Seller.About Company, Product & Seller:1. SanDisk Ultra is a brand of Western Digital which is the same company that sells external hard-disk storage devices under the brand WD Elements and WD Portable.2. About 3 to 5 years ago, WD Elements & Portable drives of 2TB and 4TB were priced Rs. 1200 less than current day prices. They were sold by Cloudtail Seller on Amazon.3. Now SanDisk and WD drives are sold by Appario Retail Seller on Amazon.4. For best prices on SanDisk and WD products in India, the current seller has the lowest prices for authentic brand new products.5. Reason for higher prices for same brand's same capacity storage devices may be various - such as import duties, taxes, manufacturing costs, higher demand for the brand, etc.REVIEW: SanDisk Ultra Dual 64GB USB 3.0 OTG Pen Drive (Gold):1. STORAGE SPACE: Just as in external hard-disk drives, the actual usable storage space will be less than what is mentioned on the product.2. SAME AS OTHERS: For the 64GB pen drive, actual storage space available is 57.2GB. This is normal and not some fraud or fake advertisement. This is because it has FAT32 File System. Also, the device uses some space for its functionality and use.- In Linux OS laptop the available storage space on this FAT32 pen drive is shown to be 61.5GB. So that's 4GB more than what Windows OS calculates using their NTFS File System.3. HEATING: Even with just 10 minutes of use, you can touch and feel that the metal part of the pen drive is getting heated. But the performance of the drive has not got affected by the heat. This heating does not happen in WD external hard-disks and seems to be unique to small pen drives of various brands.4. MOBILE PHONES: The pen drive works with Android OS of Mi phones such as Redmi Note running Android including old Android Version 9 as well.5. TOO TIGHT FOR PHONES: The pen drive is a tight fit on mobile phones & tablets - so be careful when pulling it out so as to not damage your phone - because this is also the charging point for your phone. If you feel that your phone is too tight for this pen drive, then it is best not to use it for phone data storage management.6. VALUE FOR MONEY: Even if you don't use this pen drive for mobile phone - it is still the best price for a 64 GB pen drive with a USB 3.0 backward compatible with older USB ports on older laptops and computers.7. SPEED: The Speed is extremely good for Windows OS laptop, Linux OS laptop and Android Mobile Phones.8. FILE SYSTEM FORMATTING THE PEN DRIVE: Unless you are sure you won't use your pen drive on a particular device, don't format the pen drive to change its FAT32 File System.But For Example, If you have decided that you won't use it on mobile phones or tablets because the fitting is too tight and you don't want to risk damage to this point which is primarily used for charging - then go ahead and format the pen drive for your laptop.- With NTFS formatting you will see an increase in available storage space in your pen drive.- With your Linux system's file format, you will have better storage space than any Windows File System.- BEWARE that if the pen drive has NTFS File System then it won't work with mobile phones, tablets, laptops which don't have Windows Operating System. Same way, if you format the pen drive for Linux OS File System, it won't be recognised on Windows laptops, Android phones, tablets, etc.- if like most people you will be using this pen drive on laptops or other devices of friends or co-workers, then leave the existing FAT32 File System as it is.9. FREE APP: Memory Zone App for Android is bundled free in this pen drive. It is easy to install and doesn't take any Phone Permissions other than Storage Access. It is very useful App with easy user-interface. App takes 64MB storage space on Android Phones.- Features include: cleaning Junk Files that you may not otherwise know through your phone's File Manager App. Enable or Disable Automatic Backup to your pen drive. Add Cloud Storage such as Google Drive or Microsoft One Drive and Add MicroSD card storage to manage all your files from just one Memory Zone App. Restore Backup. Copy, Move, Delete, files as well as clean up WhatsApp related files. See available storage space on your phone. See data sorted into photos, videos, music, documents.10. BEWARE - Users of Memory Zone App should know that they agree to Terms of Use which include that if some government agency requests the company for information against piracy - such as illegal copy, storage, distribution of Movies, Music, Software, Books, etc as per DMCA copyright laws then the Company will provide the user's data to the government investigating agency to protect the intellectual property of content owners.OVERALL - best product in the market, at best price in Indian market, with features not offered by other companies for similar specs.,Value for money. May be desig can be improve for the sliding and handling,It was good with compatibility and storage of data but its slow in data transfer. It take so much time for moving and copying of files,Good quality,Good Quality product,Pendrive Quality to Aacchi H Par , Storage 64 Gb Ki jagah 61 Gb Hi Milta H 3Gb Kam Milta H par accha hai Original Pandrive H‡§™‡•á‡§®‡§°‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§á‡§µ ‡§ì‡§∞‡§ø‡§ú‡§ø‡§®‡§≤ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§ï‡•ç‡§µ‡§æ‡§≤‡§ø‡§ü‡•Ä ‡§≠‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ‡§´‡•Ä ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡•Ä ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§•‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§∏‡§æ ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ü‡•ã‡§∞‡•á‡§ú ‡§ï‡§Æ ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§§‡•Ä‡§® ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§¨‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§æ 64 ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§¨‡•Ä ‡§ï‡§ø ‡§ú‡§ó‡§π 61 ‡§ú‡•Ä‡§¨‡•Ä ‡§π‡•Ä ‡§Æ‡§ø‡§≤‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç, ‡§á‡§∏‡•ç‡§§‡•á‡§Æ‡§æ‡§≤ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡•á ‡§ü‡§æ‡§á‡§Æ ‡§•‡•ã‡§°‡§º‡§æ ‡§ó‡§∞‡•ç‡§Æ  ‡§π‡•ã‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç ‡§™‡§∞ ‡§Ö‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æ ‡§ï‡§æ‡§Æ ‡§ï‡§∞‡§§‡§æ ‡§π‡•à‡§Ç |,Good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41sAt4BZydL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/SanDisk-Ultra-Dual-64GB-Drive/dp/B01N6LU1VF/ref=sr_1_145?qid=1672903002&s=computers&sr=1-145,41

Just excellent. Accuracy top notch. Feeling while in hande is awesome. Feels very big in hand. Very comfortable to hold for long time. Design is very good.,nice mouse love it... decent mouse with ecent price..,If you are buying this mouse exclusively for gaming, don't cause the polling rate is no different than lets say a cheap dell mouse you see at work (exact polling rate of this mouse is 125hz which is very low if you want precise aiming in competitive). But the redeeming feature might be the looks. The rgb looks cool (but you cant use just one single color). It feels great in hand but my thumb has to pull back a lot to press the lower side button but that can be attributed to my long thumb. The cables braided too so there's that!Verdict: Great value is you can get it for around Rs. 400 considering its looks and other subtle features.,,A fine mouse for what it's worth.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31luFfya0kL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Redgear-Gaming-Semi-Honeycomb-Windows-Gamers/dp/B08CHZ3ZQ7/ref=sr_1_177?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-177,27

It was easy to setup as a extender . Signal is also good but not that great. It can cover 1 flat well . Signal breaks if moving upstairs or downstairs. Overall great purchase. Must buy,Need little better customer support,good,I expected much stronger signal 10 meter away. Its okay working, but not as expected.,tp link is good product,Good product,Decided on buying this Router from TP-Link after days of research, reading reviews and talking to many people regarding different models.Was on a 20 Mbps connection with a Netgear N300 router since 2016 which used to suffice for moderate usage till now. However, with increase in the number of devices like Smart TV, 2 iPads and a laptop etc, it necessitated an upgrade. Also, considering the current work-from-home scenario which is bound to continue for the foreseeable future as well, the internet usage was being stretched to it's limit and the trusted Netgear router simply couldn't match up to the increased bandwidth demand.To capitalise on the current situation, our current ISP came out with interesting Fibre broadband plans and we opted for a 75 mbps connection. That in turn needed a new router to utilize it's optimum potential. Finally zeroed in on the TP-Link Archer C80 after reading some horror stories of other available routers. Was also tempted to buy the AX1500 considering there's barely any price difference, but then came across a few reviews which stated that Wifi 6 is not entirely successfully implemented and might prove to be an hindrance to use with our current range of devices.Order delivered by Amazon within a day. Full marks for the seamless delivery as always. Prime has truly been a boon.Installed the Router today. Installation via Tether App was seamless. ISP guy helped with the PPPOE sign-in process and released the MAC ID which was bound to our old Router. The whole process was done in 10 mins and we were online.The dual bands are truly a boon. Have divided the devices at home equally between 2.4G and 5G as per usage. As the router is close to the TV unit, have connected it to 5G and also alternatively connected via the Ethernet cable (just in case).Speed tests:Started off by streaming 4k content simultaneously on 2 devices connected to 5G. Played seamlessly even with other devices like mobiles etc being connected.Have attached a few pictures for reference.- Sitting near the Router, 5G Download speed is 77 mbps and Upload is 75.4 mbps.- 5G speed tested in the bedroom with a wall in between: Download 72.4 mbps and Upload 74.9 mbps.- 2.4G speed in the same room as the Router is: Download 68.3 mbps and Upload 79.2 mbps. (This is quite surprising as a few reviews mentioned 50-55 mbps will be the threshold for 2.4G. Used to get a maximum of 45 mbps download on my old N300).- Speed Test via the Ethernet cable provided in thr box connected to the TV: Download 78 mbps and Upload 75 mbps.Couldn't have asked for more really. This seems to be totally ideal.Build quality of the device is decent and the antennas seem well enough to do the job, however would have preferred that they were placed like other TP-Link models like the Archer A6, so it would have been easier to move them in preferred directions.The LED lights are a little weirdly placed and not bright enough. Maybe I'm used to the prominent lights on my old Router. These are a blink-and-miss sort and you have to bend a little to check in case there's an issue. One big element missing in this device is a USB port which is absolutely essential in today's age and expected to be included for this price range. Wonder what's the reason behind giving it a miss.I have sealed the extra LAN ports with tape to protect from dust or moisture. It's a good practice. The outer design of the router is quite sophisticated and stylish, however I'm a little worried of dust accumulating in the intricate design on the top portion.Functionally though, this seems to be a real good offering from TP-Link. Hope this device lives up to expectations in coming days. All-in-all, seems to be a worthy investment for the next few years, considering an internet plan upgrade, if any.Hope I touched upon major points which might help other interested consumers in making a choice. This product is RECOMMENDED! :)",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41c7bJo7ooL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Archer-C20-Wireless-Router/dp/B0759QMF85/ref=sr_1_187?qid=1672903004&s=computers&sr=1-187,50

With an overall positive impression of Logitech's performance (compared to my experience with similar from Dell, HP) - I decided to try the slightly cheaper and compact MK215.While I knew this would be more compact, with fewer keys - I feel I should highlight the disadvantages I can see immediately (especially for users of full-size keyboards at work - refer image)1. While my hands will get used to closer keys - they also seem much less ""springy"" (lower). Overall size is also too small to place on one's lap and type, which I could with the other wireless keyboard, especially during WFH.2. Big point is the MUCH larger size of the dongle. This will need to be removed and stashed carefully at home every time I throw my laptop into my bag for a meeting. I never did this for MK270 and simply kept dongle fixed forever to my laptop USB port. That dongle also had a slot inside the mouse for safekeeping, which is not there in MK215.3. Neither mouse nor keyboard has a switch off - MK270 had switch on both. MK215 mouse takes 2 AA, whereas MK270 takes 1 battery.4. Mouse is shaped different - lower arch and wider - which may simply take adjusting. Feels a little cheaper.While a real review can only be provided much later - seeing how keys/clicks perform over the long run (and one hopes that Logitech will have taken care of that quality) - while I don't have any complaints so far, I feel paying a bit extra for the MK270 may suit many folks out there. Hope the review helps - will update later if I see find any fundamental issues with time.,Product is good but lagging very much.Not enjoying/ satisfied with this product.Bad  for meüòûüòî.,It is working fine till now.,The keyboard is good but pretty small when compared with regular keyboards.

It can be adjusted for different heights. Grip to the table is really good. It helps to view the laptop with required angle. Easy to carry. Looks really great on a black table. Classic silver piece. Packaging is also very good.,3.5 starsI got this delivered today and tried it out. My laptop is 2.5 KG and 17 inches, a bit of a heavy machine.While the stand held my laptop, it did not fit properly. Because of the laptop's weight or the size, the front of the laptop raises instead of staying on the padded notches. Have to move the machine forward a bit for it to stay on.If you want to use it as simply a stand - where you set the laptop and use external devices to use it like the mouse, gamepad or the keyboard, it is fine. You can go for it.If you want to use the machine itself when on the stand - touchpad and keyboard, you might face some issues. Using it directly is making the machine a bit wobbly.Will test it out with heavy work / gaming to see how the temperature holds. Might edit the review and the rating after using it a bit.,The product itself is awesome and in modern day where ease to carry and compact products are preferred it is a good choice , my only reason to give 4 stars and removing one out of five is the product latches (linkages/arms that set the level of elevation angle ) are bit free And can be undone from one of either side with a slight jerk while the second side latch supports all the weight in the meantime.,It is very convenient and compact to carry along with you.

Probably a direct plug in extension (no cord) would be a much better option.,Needed a portable USB extension. Headphones, keyboard and mouse. Serves the purpose for an indoor setting. Have explained why it is not an outdoor device under the cons.Pros:- Nice design, Sleek, unobtrusive suits some work environments. For those who have limited table estate, go for models that have vertical USB slots, saves space. This is for those who can have it flat next to the laptop/computer. (check image)- Works well for Audio, HIDs, and great for Data Transfer.Observation:- An interesting observation when using usb keyboard, the USB drive is as if not more sensitive than direct typing. With mechanical USB keyboards there is a latency but chiclet and USB Dongle based wireless keyboards seem to work well.- USB or wireless USB (RF) mouse works perfectly. Very little noticeable latency- Not for gaming purposes (keyboards/mice/joysticks etc.). This is a no brainer. In rapid response gaming environments were latency is life or death. An extension is not an option.Cons: (Check Image)The USB female slots in the extension are shallow. The male plugs do not go in fully. There is 0.5 cm of the metal plug exposed. This may be a risk in exposed/outdoor environments. Humidity increases the chances of electric shock, and dust being an insulator may cause static electricity build up. The worst case is if a conductor falls across the exposed points, the whole system can short out.Suggest the designers take this into consideration for their next batch of products. The depth of the USB slots needs to accommodate the full length of the USB plugs.Functionally it works, design leaves a lot wanting. Go for it if are sure you can be safe, go for a different model if you need this for outdoor use.Update: 15th Nov 2022On connecting the keyboard to the usb drive, there seems to be an increased latency and sometimes the keyboard does not respond as anticipated. The text does not appear on the screen immediately and sometimes a particular letter just cascades repeatedly, and one has to press backspace often to delete the excess letters. For data transfer it works fine but has lower speeds, when all four slots are being used. Expected probably!,Works well and does the job.,I like it very much.Value for money...,Product is excellent.

I'm genuinely surprised.First of all, I'd give this a 3.5/5 instead of the 4 but I rounded it up instead of down because there's more to like than dislike.Product was delivered promptly but the packaging was in rough shape. When I unpacked it, the keyboard had three missing keys (iirc it was left Alt, Z and the Windows keys). I turned over the box and dumped everything and voila! The missing keys fell out. Not off to a great start but I slapped those keys on (which was very straightforward meaning that replacing keycaps in the future will be relatively easy) and plugged in the receiver to my laptop. No setup or 3rd party software necessary, it just started working instantly. Pretty seamless.I only use the keyboard when I connect my laptop to my TV and I'm sitting at a distance, I use my laptop's keyboard otherwise. I absolutely love the keyboard. I was expecting it to feel wonky and cheap but it actually feels decent. It's not super premium but it's much better than what I was expecting for the price. It has flip stands on the back to raise it and an on/off switch if you want to conserve battery. The keys themselves are full sized, and as someone with larger hands, I really appreciate it. The curve around the space bar looks cool but I don't think it adds anything ergonomically. The typing experience is nice, the keys have enough feedback to them (not mechanical levels obviously, but still satisfying enough). The Caps Lock key has a little raised bit to it so you can feel it without looking at it and don't accidentally hit it while typing, neat little addition. The shortcut/media keys on top all work fine with Windows 11. There's not much else to say about the keyboard. It should be more than sufficient for everyday office/browsing/school tasks and will be good and comfy for people who type a lot. Do not buy this expecting a gaming level keyboard with antighosting, etc or buy it expecting to have the durability of a true mechanical keyboard. I was initially going to mark it down for not having any backlight at all but given the budget, that's understandable and acceptable. Overall, I very much like the keyboard and find it to be above par for what you pay.The mouse, on the other hand (no pun intended), is mediocre at best. The build quality is not good; it does not feel good when you use either of the click buttons, you can feel the inner mechanisms groaning, like it's gonna fall apart at any time. The mouse also starts lagging randomly. The lag only lasts a couple of seconds but it occurs enough to be an annoyance. Also, it just doesn't feel good in your palm. I have an Amazon Basics mouse that I purchased while I was in the US for $7 (~520rs) and that thing feels so much sturdier and better built than this. It also has no lagging issues and the clicks feel smooth even after a few years of use.As an overall package, I would say it's decent for the price. There are lots of other sets in this price range and I picked this literally because of the Logitech branding since I own a few other Logitech products and enjoy them a lot. The keyboard is doing all the heavy lifting here and carrying it's mouse friend. I hope they improve the mouse going forward because then, this would be the best combo in this range. As it stands right now, it's fairly indistinguishable from its competitors.Recommended for - people looking for an affordable wireless set for everyday computer work and people who type a lot.Not recommended for - gaming or any form of power users. It might work for single player games like city builders, grand strategy, RTSes, etc but I would not recommend it for any form of shooters, especially online. The mouse simply isn't up to task.,,The Keyboard is good and working nice. for me the Mouse is too small and not able to use properly and getting pain after using for very less time only. it will be good if the mouse is in regular size. Also the mouse is lagging a bit even after changing the settings.,I using this product since one year not any problem found.Even battery cell not change,I don't really know if it's worth the cost or not. But, I mainly prefer silent typing and mouse clicks. Ergonomic is also a must as I use these for long hours.Currently, I use logitech m590 mouse which is really awesome and makes almost no noise at all.,Great Product,I have been using this product for 2years. It's battery is great, still running. The keys could get hard with time, therefore i had to use WD-40 to lubricate them. After 2years, some random keys have stopped working, such Del, Semicolon, Numpad-3. The mouse's right click isn't functioning anymore. The left click has irritating double click issue. So not suited for FPS games. Speed and connection is adequate, no lag noticed. The keyboard collects a lot of dust so better to cover it. Ergonomics are great no issue with that. If you're looking for a longer size keyboard for approx. 2years of proper functioning for daily or official use, then it is a good purchase. Mouse is small and comfortable, even for left handed people. Keep in mind the keys WILL become stiff over time.,I purchased it for my personal use , which includes mostly working, it has good connectivity both for keyboard and mouse . I have not faced any issue with it. I have not tested its performanace.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41X6hey-ExL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Logitech-Wireless-mk270r-Keyboard-Mouse/dp/B00CEQEGPI/ref=sr_1_268?qid=1672903008&s=computers&sr=1-268,15

I'm using this with my MacBook it works fine . While using this adapter Amazon prime videos can't play in 1080p resolution on monitor it says the devices not support hd . Other ports are working fine not a problem.,I took this for my macbook m2 pro 2022 edition and it is working perfectly,all the ports are working fine till now ,it's been 2 month i am using it , length of the wire is little small it could be little big and the price is also little high it could be under 900rs ,then it will justify.,If you bought a MacBook Air or Pro recently and wondering what to do about all the missing ports - USB, HDMI etc, this is your one stop solution.I tried on my MacBook Air M2 and it works like a charm. I connected, various pen drives, disk drives and a 128 go flash drive - all worked fine.Very reasonably priced compared to other options, yet has a fairly good look and feel.,Everything working fine but it doesn't works with Macbook's HDMI when try to connect one plus TV as an extended screen( different displays on both) but works fine if used as second screen with common display.,Solved my problem,I got the product on 11th August 2022. This is the initial impression.1) Packaging - The package I received was in good condition. it had a pre wrapped plastic on the box. No complaint about packaging but one thing to note is that 'No Brand name on the packaging.' Although when you open the product , the brand name is there on the product.2) Build - Wire length is small to my opinion. It has a metal build finish and looks premium and sturdy. Wire quality is also good but at this price should have provided braided cable.3) I have tested this product with 3 usb ports connected - a) Mouse b) Keyboard c)External 2TB SSD. SSD does not get disconnected when all 3 usb are connected. For confirmation i did a 2 gb file transfer and No disconnections were noticed.Note : The Speed of the data transfer is low. I did 2 gb file transfer and was getting the max speed of  39MB/s with the SSD connected through the usb hub.Although when I did the same file transfer by directly connecting the SSD to the laptop port, i got speed of 111 MB/s. So if you want to do lot of file transfer better connect it directly and not through the usb hub.So far initial impression are good, let see how long it last.,Sometimes not detected by MAC and quality is not that good",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T2/images/I/41qTZXl3KaL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Verilux%C2%AE-Multiport-Adapter-Portable-Compatible/dp/B09163Q5CD/ref=sr_1_284?qid=1672903008&s=computers&sr=1-284,33

I listed my priorities under various heads to come up with a conclusion and let us compare the actual product based upon my initial requirements:1.) DATA EXCHANGE:*****************************Since it was to be primarily used for fast mobile devices charging in car, Data exchange capability was not much of my concern. Preference though would surely have been a USB 3 but it didn‚Äôt bother me if I could only get a USB 2.0 too.ACTUAL PRODUCT: I did try to copy a movie file just for the sake of testing data exchange and I found it to be pretty well. I did not capture any speed data but then we all know speed of data transfer also varies with the type of data being transferred. The more variety of data being transferred simultaneously the lower will be the speed.2.) LENGTH OF THE CABLE :**************************************Again since I could not afford to have a lengthy loop of cable bunched around my gear knob, I preferred to keep it short & simple hence my only lookout was upto around a meter or below.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable came nicely packed in a paper packet and was precisely 0.9 meters or approximately 3 feet long. The length was sufficient for me to plug-in any of the mobile devices to my car charger at the drivers or the side passenger‚Äôs seat.3.) TANGLE FREE/ FLEXIBILITY/ STRENGTH STANDARDS:**************************************************************************I am not particularly a fan of those stubborn braided wires which are so hard that they retain the shape in which they are bent. I wanted something that was thick yet flexible enough to acquire a circular shape when bunched.ACTUAL PRODUCT: The cable received looked exactly as shown over the site with good flexibility , reasonable thickness & a sturdy intermediate cable. The whole construction of the cable due it‚Äôs cable size & flexibility is almost tangle-free.The associated cable was not exactly thick but can‚Äôt be termed as thin or delicate too. It‚Äôs not the thickest I‚Äôve seen but then thickest doesn‚Äôt always means most durable. Given my application it‚Äôs more than just suitable.The overall built & quality of the cable & insulation looks promising enough to last few years. Even if used for other than car charging it looks durable enough to last long.I had further shortlisted mansaa & an amkette cable for the same purpose but they were too long for my requirement.4.) COMPACT MOULDED CONNECTORS:*********************************************************Had an inclination towards moulded connectors to avoid any issues where the connectors break open exposing the terminal PCBs.ACTUAL PRODUCT : There are no complaints regarding the connectors of the actual cable. The connectors are perfectly moulded without any joints or risks of splitting open. The connector casings are further quite compact at terminals to fit in comfortably at scarce spaces.The connector ports are sturdy enough both at USB A & micro B ports. The micro B port pins lock securely onto the charging mobile devices which is quite good.No signs of loose construction.Being Gold-plated is more of a misleading & fancy term(in this case) as most of the metal ports designed today already have a corrosion resistance & nobody is going to use them in saline sea water anyways.5.) AVAILABILITY OF TIES/VELCRO STRAPS :***********************************************************As per my intended use in a car where compactness was of paramount importance, I expected an included cable tie or a Velcro strap would be a nice add-on to properly adjust & arrange the cable as per requirement.ACTUAL PRODUCT: This I miss the most in the provided actual cable, there is no provision of an included strap or cable tie through which I could adjust my required cable length easily.6.) DECENT CURRENT HANDLING CAPABILITY:******************************************************************On the newest QC 3.0 certified chargers the current transmission can go up to 3.4 amps in certain cases hence the cable needed to have a decent current handling ability.ACTUAL PRODUCT : The actual cable has a nameplate rating of handling up to 2.1 amps against demands at new QC 3.0 chargers that could go up to 3.4 amps. Here, let me clear out that the latest QC chargers vary voltage to current ratios to achieve desired fast charging  & thus it is not like a continuous flow of 3.4 amps is there, it keeps on reducing hence cable ratings designed for a continuous current handling of anything above 2.0 amps would sufficiently work with QC 3.0 chargers.Have tried it safely multiple times charging my Samsung S7 from 10 % without the cable getting hot.7.) WARRANTY:************************Comes with a 1 year warranty as expected. Not the best in the industry but reasonable.OTHER OBSERVATIONS:*************************************Apart from the above listed features, the other details of the actual product received worth mentioning are:8.) The cable is manufactured in China & imported by amazon warehouse dealers under the brand name & philosophy of amazonbasics.9.) The cable has a manufacturing date of Oct 2017 & it was imported to India in Dec 2017.10.) The cable has a MRP tag of 495 bucks however I purchased it online for 269 bucks.being a prime member shipping was free.11.) A customer care toll free number & email is also printed over the label for registration of any consumer grievances.FINAL VERDICT:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxIt has been few days since I have received & been using this product. So far everything from construction to performance seems to be convincing enough to recommend it and for a price of around 260 I suppose, its worth it.Will surely update if any malfunction is observed.,Worth for buy!,The quality that amazon basics at times give at cheap prices is beyond imagination. simply superb, goverment shouldnt hinder amazon products , amazon products rather gives competition to local qualityless products which consumers are forced to buy beacause they have no quality competition. Make in india is good, but if the make in india products are simple cheap copies of branded products without any investment in R and D, without R and D make in india would never be successfull and ousting companies like amazon will only lead to loss for consumers , govt should infact encourage such competition.,Amazon basics provides one of the best cables available for charging your phone or connecting devices.As an past customer of many cables from Amazon this cable doesn't also disappoint,Supports fast charging for all my Samsung phones.I use Samsung a9pro 2016, Samsung s8plus 2017, which this cable is compatible with .Very sturdy, thick and very long. 6 ftVery affordable pricing. Thanks AmazonI also use a USB c cable for my Samsung s20fe.,Super,Product charging is ok.. however it's mere 1 foot in length..  the vendor could have mentioned  correct product description.. there is no need to mislead.. too early to say performance as I have received it today.,Good,I have bought many cheap chinese micro usb cable in Rs 50 and Rs 100 of ubon and of many other chinese local companies,and none of them worked properly.Finall i decided to go for this.And it is charging as well transferring data, without any issue and i am very happy with my purchaseMy advice : Dont buy, cheap chinese local cables of.You will have to throw them in dustbean after some time.Better buy this one.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/31nrDWDT8+L._SX300_SY300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/AmazonBasics-Micro-Charging-Android-Phones/dp/B07232M876/ref=sr_1_332?qid=1672903011&s=computers&sr=1-332,9

If the device has the same matte black theme, this webcam cover can easily be merged and becomes a part of the device's body. As you can see my laptop has a matte black screen frame and astonishingly¬†the product has merged with it. The little plastic container in the package will act as storage for the rest of the webcam covers.It is ultra-thin as described by the company with¬†acquiring about a millimeter thickness. This thickness can cope with the windows¬†laptops as they are having¬†the rubber buffers on the top side of the screen frame because those buffers act as a spacer between the screen and the lower-up body/keyboard of the laptop to avoid any harm to the screen.¬†This spacer is advantageous to the webcam cover as closing the lid¬†will not harm the screen, screen frame, and laptop lower-up body. But, still, don't put pressure on the location where the webcam cover is installed as the thickness of the webcam cover is slightly more in the micrometers, than the rubber buffers of the laptop itself. The sliding function is very smooth, but be sure to push only the slider part and not the whole static part as it will make the grip weak over time of usage.The device can be used with any phone and monitor as they have no issue with opening and closing the lids.Now, for the ""Mac Laptop '' users, it is not a product for your¬†laptop, and never try this product for your Mac laptops. As the Mac laptops have a stunning plain glass screen that is covering the whole screen frame part and has no spacers, that is there's no space left after closing the laptop lid and hence upon installation of this¬†product will damage (crack/break) the plain glass screen.Installation is easy, remove the blue tape and carefully stick the cover as a sticker, using the scale for support, or else you could stick it a little inclined. After sticking, rub your palm for heat generation and grab the screen frame from both palms and apply the ultra-light pressure and hold the position up to a good 2 to 5 minutes. And there you go for your satisfied invisible life.*Important - Even if not in use, slide it 2-5 times once a week and clean it as per your device cleaning schedule to avoid jamming due to debris or dust.Overall, it is a good product. For me, it has worked awesome. Green Signal from here.Thank You :)SUGGESTIONSTo the Manufacturer - Notice the static frame of the webcam¬†cover, and make its edges (the edges close to the slider) smooth (rounding off or fillet), so that upon sliding the slider with a fat finger, it can easily¬†slide over the edges of the static frame hence do not put an unnecessary force on a static frame.To the Seller - Well packagingTo the Consumer - Check for the rubber spacers/buffers provided in the laptop (like Windows laptops), if it is then you can use the webcam cover, if not (like Mac laptops), it's not the product for you. Even for Windows laptops, after installing a webcam cover, try not to put pressure on the webcam cover location for long. Slide it 2-5 times once a week to avoid jamming.DISCLAIMERThe review(s) and rating(s) has(ve) been made upon personal usage(s) / experiment(s) / experience(s) / perspective(s) for specific product(s) acquired / delivered.,I usually don't trust my webcam so I thought of giving this product a try. It was delivered within 3 days after placing the order. I received it on 12th June. First impressions were really good. I always had a fear that It would crack my screen when I close my laptop lid after reading the reviews but It's been 3.5 months and there's not even a single crack in my screen.ùóïùòÇùó∂ùóπùó± ùó§ùòÇùóÆùóπùó∂ùòÅùòÜ ùü∞.ùü±/ùü±You will get 3 webcams covers in the package. It's extremely thin. So, It won't cause any issues when you close the laptop(Hp pavilion gaming used here) but It might cause issues in the case of laptops with thin screens like MacBook Air, Asus TUF, Asus ROG while closing the lid due to the pressure on the screen. At the end it's your choice.ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª ùüØ/ùü±I am sorry to say that the Adhesion of this product is quite weak. It literally falls off after a week of applying it. I had to throw 2 of it as it became useless. I only had the last piece remaining.ùó¶ùóºùóπùòÇùòÅùó∂ùóºùóª ùó≥ùóºùóø ùóîùó±ùóµùó≤ùòÄùó∂ùóºùóª : Eventually I was able to find a solution for this problem.‚Ä¢ Remove the Stock Adhesion by gently applying Isopropyl alcohol.‚Ä¢ Then apply a strong Adhesive glue (I used Fevi Kwick). Apply it only on the back edges of the webcam  cover. Since it's extremely thin, I used thin needle to apply Super Glue gently on it or else the Superglue  will spill out and make a mess.‚Ä¢ Immediately you have to place it on the webcam of our laptop. And then you're good to go.Its been 3 months after using the Super Glue technique. Forget about about falling, It has not even moved a bit. No effect on the quality of my webcam. The cover won't interfere when you are using your webcam in meetings. And fully covers it when you want privacy. Overall, Its a good product except for the fact that it has poor adhesion.,Good product,I wish I had known this before ordering. Luckily a friend made me aware the very same day I had applied it.Apple urges people not to close their MacBook, MacBook Air or MacBook Pro, while such camera covers are applied because it can lead to cracks in the screen when closing your MacBook!!! It may also affect the ambience light sensor, but that is the lesser issue as compared to a potentially cracked screen and high repair costs.MacBooks are designed in a way that when closing no foreign object thicker than an average printer paper (0.1mm) should ever be between the screen and the body of the laptop. This item is 0.027inches thick, that is 0.6mm, six times the recommended thickness!!!If you are going to use it on your MacBook, be sure to completely remove it before closing your laptop. You can use it without worry on iMac as it's a desktop and doesn't get closed. You can also use it with any normal laptop where the camera isn't embedded inside the glass screen. If you have a laptop where the camera is embedded in the plastic frame around the screen it should be okay.For disappointed MacBook users like me there are two options. One is you trust Apple, who are saying their camera is hardwired to the green camera light. According to them one cannot work without the other, so even if someone hacks your camera, you will know it is on because the green light will be glowing.If you're not sure about their reliability and you still want to cover your camera, use a piece of thin tape. Apple does advice against anything which could leave adhesive residue on their screen, but frankly, if you just clean it with some screen cleanser after removing, i don't see how there could be an issue.Why am I still giving this product 3 stars? It reached in good condition, is easy to install and use, and it will still be useful to people with other laptops or desktop screens with inbuilt camera. It's not a bad product. They just need to stop advertising it for MacBooks!",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41PeQz-jDSL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/LIRAMARK-Webcam-Blocker-Computer-MacBook/dp/B08BQ947H3/ref=sr_1_335?qid=1672903011&s=computers&sr=1-335,20

Do not read another review.,Nice product,From 0 to 70 ‚Ä¶,Good External Wifi Signal Provider,Superb,Awesome and easy to use,Good product","I am using this on an old Mac Mini, since the Broadcom proprietary drivers aren't available and the replacement B43 drivers don't allow for sufficient download speeds, at least in my experience. I got this device up and running with Ubuntu 22.04 with Linux 5.15.0-56-generic.Google search for ""morrownr/8821au-20210708"" and use the driver on Github. I'm using the product ""TP-Link AC600"" btw. If you are using the other variant sold on Amazon, use lsusb and find out which network interface you are going to have to install drivers for. GIYF.I will admit, this is probably going to be hard for someone who is not generally comfortable with a shell, bash for example. But even though I had never used dkms or iw before, the Github repo along with the build tools available in the jammy repo made it easy enough to get the device working (read the GitHub Readme).To be sure I first got the drivers working in a local Ubuntu VM using Guest Additions to connect to the USB device directly from the guest OS, which also worked.Ultimately, I installed the OS on the host and setup the drivers using USB tethering. I then got the same download speed using this device I was previously getting on my other network interfaces on Windows and Mac, but now on Ubuntu.The device itself is a bit sensitive to the antenna direction when it comes to the impact on download speed. Have been using for about a month now without complaints.,Do not go for reviews that say that it do not support kali. Me and some of my friends all are using it for Wi-Fi hacking and it works really well, it also supports monitor mode. If you are having issues in connecting it to your Kali machine then just go through the web surf a bit and you will find relevant articles on how to connect this TP link adapter to your kali machine. There is also a driver of realtek which you might need to install to make it work in your kali machine.I have given it 4 stars just because the performance if not good as the Alpha adapters which is reasonable for this range of price but in this range and for as a beginner it is the best adapter you can buy.,Nice product. Working fine. My PC is now 5G  Price is too high so giving 4 star,Got the Wi-Fi in one of the rooms from 0 to 70%. Has been working well since a month now. Good alternative to a repeater if only a single device needs to access the Wi-Fi from a corner.,The product is very nice and have good Wifi signal. Using this for over a month now, no complain. But when it for the first time, you need to install the driver on your desktop/laptop from the TP link website to make it operational, which is not very well explained in the manual.,This product is very good,I have buy this product because my laptop don‚Äôt support wifi 5ghz band, in 2.5 ghz I receive 30-40Mbps speed only but my broadband plan is 150Mbps.1. Easy to use plug and play windows 102. Good signal i am using another room from router no signal drop , I receive full signal.3. Little bit expensive but go with this because of good signal.4. I receive 170Mbps + download and 110Mbps upload speed on 5ghz and my broadband plan is 150Mbps.I highly recommend this product.,i purchase this product for company use and this is a very good product.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/216Q4FqmZVL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/TP-Link-Wireless-Adapter-Archer-T2U/dp/B07P681N66/ref=sr_1_341?qid=1672903012&s=computers&sr=1-341,48

Double clicking within a month and scroll wheel scrolling in the reverse direction randomly.Edit 1The warranty requires you to take the mouse to their service centre which was a pain as it took me a while to find the nearest service centre and the address was incorrect. The service centre was helpful though as they replaced my mouse in a matter of minutes with no hassle. Will edit based on how the replacement works.Edit 2Replacement mouse working well so far.,This mouse feels and looks awesome, the slight rubbery texture feels premium and the build quality is also amazing, but the clicks seems to be a little sensitive. For regular use it‚Äôs amazing. Can‚Äôt get better but for gaming, i would want a mouse with a little sturdier click, i click heavy during gaming and the mouse may take it but it remains in my head. So even for light gaming it‚Äôs fine where use of click is less as compared to fps shooting games.,It is an awesome upgrade for beginner level gamers, just changing mouse can actually improve your experience and gameplay. My boyfriend recommended this to me as we play Valorant together and my aim was persistently bad even though i tried so hard playing with regular Bluetooth dell mouse, changing from that to this piece was a great doing, 100% recommended if you're just starting to play anything like CSGO/Valorant or any other first person shooter game on regular basis.,i purchased it on16dec and i am writing this on 19dec and i'll be honest no other mouse can offer this much quality in this price so if you can buy it just go ahead but but there's an alternative mouse by razer almost the same price razer deat ader i guess that's the name so you better check that one if rgb is not your priority yiu can choose that one bye....,Go for it,Design is easy to hold and there are extra buttons on right side which I find very useful.

Item runs 1hr 14m @1A giving 15.465Wh, runs 48m @1.5A giving 14.82Wh whereas its rated at 22.2Wh & since its april'21 made, i'd say battery is defective & wont last me long, ordered replacement.2. Replacement runs 1h 32m @1A giving 19.39Wh, 1h 1m @1.5A giving 18.452Wh & being made in nov'20 i think this batt is alright. I'm keeping the replacement & ending my review unless item fails catastrophically.=======Update...1. This is what ""make in India"" has become- a plethora of Indian registered companies slapping their logo & selling chinese items in India, to cash in Indian sentiments. This is a generic item sold by slapping diff brand names like zinq, quantum (available right here on amazon) & prolly more. Even the boxes r exactly same... lol.2. Recharge rate is horribly slow @0.5A, so 2.2Ah will take 4.4hrs, considering losses 4.5hrs. That's why frequent power cut ppl r complaining about 1hr standby. So its basically for ppl with occasional power cuts (like me with community generator).3. Ups has to be turned ON to recharge... what? why? lame! This is another reason ppl r complaining about charging issue & since item is generic, ZINQ prolly doesn't even know... lol... such a dumb thing must be printed on the center of the box itself. I myself was fooled for 6hrs thinking that its charging but it went cold so checked with power meter & wow! It didn't charge a bit.4. Had i been younger with lotza free time, i could've made one myself for ‚Çπ80+80+80+150+50 for 1.8Ah one... Gone r those fun days! So I'm keeping it for ‚Çπ1001.** if any1 is reading my review, youtube search for ""router ups"" & lotza young ppl with free time have made such DIY.===============Damn this thing can output over 35watts of power @12v. For the 1st time something has out-specked my 35w load tester.Pros-1. Can output 3A or even more, that i could test. Great for sudden load surge.2. Very stable output 12-12.1v throughout 0-35w.3. Solid built, almost all possible connectors provided, seamless switching from AC to battery (obviously), easy to use.Cons-1. No polarity changing option for in/out. Some items/chargers do have center negative, for that i have to make my own cable.2. Since it went 3A or above, i dont think theres any overload/short circuit protection.3. Item got quite hot when run at 12v 2A for 15mins. I hope theres thermal protection.4. Item is sealed shut. Any repair or future battery change will be destructive.,It works as intended and gives 4-5 hours battery backup for wi-fi.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/4148+QSBxXL._SY300_SX300_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/Zinq-Technologies-ZQ-6600-Intercom-Set-top/dp/B08FGNPQ9X/ref=sr_1_383?qid=1672903013&s=computers&sr=1-383,50

It works and works well every time.However, they made 2 strange design decisions that take some points off the satisfaction of using of the product:1) There is a bright white light on the product which keeps flashing when the connection is active. It is a huge annoyance when I‚Äôm working at night.2) The cable is flat, which is like a double-edged sword. On one hand, it comes in handy when folding it on itself and redacting into the body. But when it‚Äôs not hidden and used with a laptop, with the adapter being visible, the flat cable folded sideways looks ugly.The product would‚Äôve been a perfect 5/5 if TP Link didn‚Äôt make these strange design decisions.

The mic is also very good. Durability needs time to tell. The last Redgear lasted about 2 years.,It's so comfortable to wear,I have even tried the Cosmic Byte Gs430 from the same price range, though i find these pair to be more value for money.Comfort- They are comfortable, the earcups are very soft and recommended if you do gaming for longer periods of time.Design- The design is actually pretty good considering the price range.Mic- the microphone's quality is actually great considering the price.Connectivity- recommended if your pc/laptop has a seperate mic and sound jack. You have to buy a splitter if you want to use the mic on a mobile. What I've noticed with other headsets is they provide a single jack for sound and mic output. But these come with 2 jacks so thats a plus point.Sound quality- These pair of headphones are only recommended for casual gaming and media consumption, the sound quality while gaming is fine, although it doesn't have that 7.1 sound but still i was able to figure out the footsteps, i also use the windows sonic for headphones and that helps too.However, at this price don't expect a good sound quality if you listen to music. The max volume feels low and the bass is almost non existent. The treble, highs and lows are done fine but buy these pair only if your priority is gaming and you are at a budget.,See the headphones are good if u are purchasing in 500to 600‚Çπ but let me tell u don't have good surround sound ,mic volume is too low you can't increase it and no bass,The Headset is overall good. Its sound quality and build quality is appreciated. At the same time, I have a few concerns, first of all, it gives a lot of pressure on both ears. So after an hour, it starts hurting.  My laptop has one input for audio. This has two. So, you have to buy an extra pin to connect it. Otherwise, go for it.,This headphone is to good in low price, Noise Cancellation is working properly , also u can adjust Volume as your choice. I'm using this headphone for my Live Stream.1 problem , if your head is big, it will fit properly otherwise moving.,This product is decent.

Nice Product & Highly Recommended.,Good quality and looks beautiful... I will surely recommend,( After using it for 3 weeks). I use Samsung M51, few months back my USB Cable was torn, so I wasn't able to fast charge. It took a decade to charge from 20-90%. Samsung original cable was too pricey and too flimsy, so I was searching for something durable. While browsing through the product page I was skeptical to place an order, as the company claimed too many features in such a low price. Keeping the negative thoughts aside I ordered it anyhow. The product was delivered well in advance, which made me happy.I unboxed and plugged in the cable, to my surprise the cable delivered everything that the company claimed. The ends have aluminum casing which makes it durable and away from regular wear and tear, it has LED indicator on both ends which turns on when the charger is plugged to the phone. Also, the box that it comes with has a secret code that you need to scratch to reveal which helps to check its authenticity.It easily fast charges my phone in an hour. Overall, I'm very happy with the product.I highly recommend this cable to anyone who needs a fast charging Type C to C cable.Will update this review if any change is observed.",https://m.media-amazon.com/images/W/WEBP_402378-T1/images/I/41gztmbiIgL._SX300_SY300_QL70_FMwebp_.jpg,https://www.amazon.in/oraimo-Charging-Syncing-Indicator-Compatible/dp/B0B86CDHL1/ref=sr_1_440?qid=1672903017&s=computers&sr=1-440,9

For me personally I tested out at multiple occassion using it for a month or two I never got speed above 38 watt and i tested it with the cable that I received from the box and it also gave me the same speed so buy carefully if you're conditions are good and you get speed more tha 50watss then only you should buy it or you should go with 3A/4A cables as they are cheaper and more durable braided cables,The cable supports fast charging (I'm using a OnePlus 65W charger) as advertised. If it could have been round and braided instead of flat ribbon cable, that would make it more durable. In my experience, braided cables are easy to wrap and store when not in use and they dont get frayed easily. My cable stopped fast charging after two months of usage but warranty support was excellent, I submitted the cable at a nearby centre and a new cable was shipped within 3 days. I've been using Boat Cables for about 6 years now (a cable from a Moto G4 phone is still with me and in use)  and will stick to them.,Got the original one, but there are fake cables being sold, so beware.It warp charges as it supports 6A power supply. The cable is long and sturdy compared to the typical OnePlus cable in the box. The price of original OnePlus cable is 890 mrp but this i got for 400 and is not unlike other third party wires. Definitely worth it. üëçüèª,Best in price segment and durable material tangle free alsi,Amazon send me a used product but the cable is super and support fast charging and the quality is also good but they sent me a used product by others if not it's super product and 3 year's of warranty on it just buy it,Very good quality fast charging cable, getting good quick charging through laptop also.Flat cable design makes it more durable.,I have a OnePlus 7t with 30 Watts charge,My original wire had been destroyed few years ago and was searching for a cable with 6v-5a for fast charging, I had buyed many wires but the phone was not charging as fast as 5he original one.

Over all good .Pros / advantage :- -1) 1.5 meter wire  2) more durable3) supported dual mode type c , micro usbCons / disadvantages:- normal charging , not fast charging,Though it is braided, but it is not strong like boAt. But it's okay to use it. Supports turbocharging.,Working well after months of use. Only thing is that if there is slight pressure, the C -type adapter will come off from the micro usb head. So better to see that the cable is not stretched when using the C type adapter. Otherwise working fine and very convenient for me since i usually have a phone with C type charging and a small Tab with micro USB charging when i travel.

But the real issue is, while I am digging my code with mouse, keyboard light goes off and I need to click CAPS or NUM key to lit it again. Its not an issue for average user, but irritates me as I sometime forget to turn on NUM lock and while typing number in my code, I accidentally change edit mode to INSERT (due to 0 pressed).

Only time when all keys are properly readable is when you look at it directly at a perpendicular angle. Since I don't need to look at the letters for normal everyday typing, I can get away with it.There are no indication in the keyboard for the FN + function key combos. Usually in other keyboard there are symbols in the function keys to indicate what they do when pressed with FN.Overall it seems to be acceptable!,Good and value for money,The silver coating came off after 3days.,Does the purpose of back-lit and typing.

Setting it up was a breeze but I faced a silly self-inflicted issue. I entered wrong WiFi password during setup but setup completed as if the connection to the router was successful. When I tried to browse, it showed ""no internet"" connection between the extender and the router. It took me some time to troubleshoot and correct the password. Ideally, the setup process should have highlighted the error and stopped the setup process showing the connection to the router was not successful, it would have saved me some headache to troubleshoot.Extender Coverage:I use the extender to reach a corner of the house about 45ft away from the router where I get sporadic and weak signal (5MBPS). I locate the extender about 30ft away from the router to extend the network and now I get a connection of 20MBPS. It is enough for my work.Speed Test Results:> At the time of testing, my laptop recorded a speed of 90MBPS next to the router.> At the point where I located the extender (30ft away), when directly connected to the router, the laptop recorded a speed of 30MBPS .> At the same point when connected to the extender, the laptop recorded a speed of 27MBPS, only 10% drop (not so bad). 15 feet away from the extender without direct line of sight, the laptop recorded 21MBPS+.Overall, I am satisfied with its performance.,https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/613f3cGFTwL._SY88.jpg,Good for home use but its Range is like till one room only it can extend, not much, but good one, like my router is in middle passage in my home but its range doesnt come out much without extender , when i started using extender it pulls the Range till this specific room, if your room is one after the other then it wont go till last room .,Extends my wifi signals and does it job very effectively.
